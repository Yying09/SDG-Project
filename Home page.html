        <h1>What is SDG?</h1>
        <p>SDG stands for <b>Sustainable Development Goals</b>. These are a set of 17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015, aimed at achieving peace and prosperity for people and the planet by 2030. The goals address challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.</p>

        <h2>SDGs Goal 7 AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY</h1>
        <p>SDG Goal 7 is to <b>“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”</b>. It focuses on increasing the use of renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and providing universal access to modern energy services</p>
        <h2>1 Why is it significant?</h2>
        <p>ccess to energy that is both economical and eco-friendly plays a pivotal role in combating global warming, curbing atmospheric contamination, nurturing progress across diverse societal facets, and ensuring uniform availability of energy solutions.</p>
        <h2>2 The current global status</h2>
        <p>The latest data indicates that the world is not on track to meet Sustainable Development Goal 7 by 2030. Currently, 733 million people lack electricity, and 2.4 billion use harmful cooking fuels. Significant acceleration in progress is required to achieve the targets</p>
        <h2>3 What is the challenges</h2>
        <ul type="square">
            <li><b>Intermittency of Renewable Sources:</b>Solar and wind energy are intermittent, dependent on weather conditions and time of day. Developing efficient energy storage systems and flexible grid management strategies are essential to ensure a consistent power supply.</li><br>
            <li><b>Energy Storage:</b> Reliable and cost-effective energy storage solutions are needed to store excess energy generated by renewables during peak production times for use during periods of low production.</li><br>
            <li><b>Infrastructure Upgrades:</b> Transitioning to clean energy requires upgrading and adapting existing energy infrastructure, including power grids, transmission lines, and distribution systems.</li><br>
            <li><b>Initial Costs:</b> While the long-term costs of clean energy are often lower, the upfront costs of building renewable energy installations and necessary grid upgrades can be significant.</li><br>
            <li><b>Technological Innovation:</b>Developing and deploying advanced clean energy technologies and innovations is essential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and address technical challenges.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h2>4 What can we do to achive this goal?</h2>
        <ol type="i">
            <li><b>Researching Sustainable Technologies:</b> Developing and improving renewable energy technologies.</li>
            <li><b>Policy Advocacy:</b>Providing evidence-based recommendations to policymakers for sustainable energy policies</li>
            <li><b>Public Engagement:</b> Increasing public awareness and education on the importance of sustainable energy</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration:</b>Working with governments, businesses, and communities to implement sustainable energy solutions</li>
            <li><b>Innovation:</b>Creating innovative approaches to energy efficiency and clean energy production</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>TAKE ACTIONS TODAY!!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Switch Off Appliances:</b> Turn off appliances and lights when not in use to save energy</li>
            <li><b>Use Energy-Efficient Products:</b> Opt for LED bulbs, energy-saving appliances, and rechargeable electronics.</li>
            <li><b>Support Renewable Energy:</b> Install solar panels, use solar-powered devices, and support renewable energy initiatives.</li>
            <li><b>Improve Energy Efficiency:</b> Upgrade insulation, use smart thermostats, and maintain heating and cooling systems for better energy use.</li>
            <li><b>Advocate and Educate:</b>Raise awareness about the importance of clean energy and advocate for policies that support sustainable energy development.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color:rgb(16, 77, 16)">These actions, combined with government policies and international cooperation, can help us move towards a more sustainable energy future.</h3>   
        <br>
        <h2>Target</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li><b>Target 7.1:</b> By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services</li>
            <li><b>Target 7.2:</b> By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix</li>
            <li><b>Target 7.3:</b> By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency</li>
            <li><b>Target 7.a:</b> By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology</li>
            <li><b>Target 7.b:</b> By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support</li>
